Hi! I am Daryna Smyrnova, my main passion is science. I have a PhD in Computational Chemsitry and naturally I love everything related to it. Especially photochemistry. And jellyfish. They are fluorescent, why wouldn't you love them?
Also, I like data science, which is...well, also kind of science. Making sense of big quatities of data and going for a ratinal choice makes my inner anxieties go down and I feel like world is a bit of a better place.
